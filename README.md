# House-Price-Modelling
This project is based on a Kaggle course on machine learning and explores predictive modeling techniques for house prices. The primary goal is to practice and reinforce key ML concepts using decision trees, random forests, and other regression models.

Key Concepts Covered:
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Model training and evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., optimizing tree size)
Comparing decision trees with random forests for improved accuracy
Making predictions on test data and generating submission files
The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition, and the project follows a structured learning approach from the course.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
